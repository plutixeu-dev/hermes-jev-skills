# Hermes Jev Skills

**Give your agent a fast, cheap second brain for the small decisions.**

Your agent burns frontier-model tokens on things that are not thinking: which model should answer this turn, which of 377 skills to load, which retrieved passages matter, which turns survive a summary, which button comes next. Those are decisions, not prose. Hand them to something that costs a fraction of a cent and answers in about 0.4 seconds, and let the expensive model do the writing.

That is what [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) is. It is TypeSafe's decision model. **It never writes text.** You give it a state and typed questions (pick one, score this, yes or no) and it answers with a calibrated confidence. This repo wires that into an agent's day.

![The model routing dashboard: the Jev on/shadow/off switch, the routing pools grid, and live decisions as they happen](docs/images/model-routing-dashboard.png)

*`jev dashboard`. The profiles, paths and decisions here are a demo home; the pools are a real working set. `python3 scripts/demo_home.py` builds a home where nothing is real, which is where the next one comes from. One switch for Jev routing, every pool as a tier-by-work-kind grid, and each decision as it happens (tier, work kind, model, which pool it came from, confidence, latency).*

## What Jev decides, and what it costs

| Skill | What Jev decides | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| **Model routing** | Which model is good enough for this turn, from every model you can call | ~0.4 s per turn |
| **Search** | Which of the results you fetched are worth opening, whether the evidence answers the question, and which of your candidate queries to run next. Jev never writes a query | ~1.9 s per round (median of five live runs, two requests: rank, then sufficiency and the pick) |
| **Memory** | Which retrieved passages are worth reading, and which contain hidden instructions | 60 passages per request, up to 480 per call; an injection screen runs locally even when Jev is down |
| **Handoffs** | Nothing, by default. We measured it: a handoff written from Jev's keep / summarize / drop digest recalled less than one written from the plain transcript. What ships is the whole dialogue, 1,200 words and a way back to the old session | 58.7% recall alone, 75.0% with one search, against 37.5% and 68.3% before ([scorecard](evals/compaction/results/SCORECARD-2026-09-20.md)) |
| **Choosing turns** | Which turns to keep when a transcript must be cut to a fixed size | 71 turns in 0.95 s; beat choosing by recency 11 questions to 4 |
| **Skill selection** | Which installed skill this turn needs, or none | 377 skills in ~2.8 s; acknowledgements answered locally for free |
| **Triage** | How urgent a message is, what kind it is, and whether a person must see it | ~0.4 s per message, $0.00006 |
| **Mailbox sorting** | Which lane an inbox message belongs in — needs reply, updates, promotional, sales, spam — and whether it is worth a person's attention | ~0.44 s p50 per message, $0.00002 each |
| **Computer use** | The next GUI action, from a table of actions you already judged safe. `--plan` splits a multi-step command once, up front | ~0.5 s per decision |
| **Browser use** | The next page action, same contract | ~0.4 s per step |

Nine skills ship as plain `SKILL.md` files, so they are not Hermes-only. The same folder works in Claude Code, Codex, or anything that reads a skill file.

```bash
jev mail --file inbox.json             # sort a mailbox into lanes
jev mail --file inbox.json --summary   # counts per lane, what was unsure, what it cost
```

## Try it in two commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kerpopule/hermes-jev-skills ~/hermes-jev-skills && python3 ~/hermes-jev-skills/install.py
```

```bash
jev setup-key   # paste your key into the one-time page it opens, then run: jev doctor
```

Python 3.9 or newer, no dependencies. Got it as a zip? Unzip it anywhere and run `python3 install.py` from that folder. Or point your agent at this repo and say *"install Hermes Jev Skills"*: it will follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

The installer finds Hermes, Claude Code and Codex on the machine and installs for each one it finds. `python3 install.py --check` shows exactly what it would do without changing anything. `--uninstall` reverses it.

**Not sure yet?** Run `jev models suggest --write` to draft routing pools from price bands, then `/jev routing shadow` for a day. Shadow mode decides and logs without switching anything, so a day of decisions costs almost nothing and risks nothing. Turn it on when the log looks right.

## On Hermes

Built for [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). The dashboard has its own notes in [router-dashboard/README.md](router-dashboard/README.md).

Start in shadow mode. It is the honest way to see what Jev would do before it does anything.

```
/jev                         status
/jev routing shadow          decide and log, do not switch (start here)
/jev routing on              switch models per turn
/jev skills on               suggest the right skill per turn
/jev notice on               show "[Jev] hard · coding → kimi-k3 · confidence 0.92" on routed replies
/jev routing on all          make it the default for every profile (a profile's own setting still wins)
```

The agent gets five tools: `jev_memory_filter`, `jev_compact_select`, `jev_choose_action`, `jev_supervise`, `jev_escalate`.

The `hermes-jev` plugin uses only public plugin seams (`pre_llm_call`, the `llm_request` middleware, tools, a slash command), so `hermes update` does not break it and nothing in Hermes core is patched.

A plugin can swap the model, not the provider connection. On OpenRouter that still covers every vendor. If you run `/model` yourself, your choice wins.

### Every model you have

```bash
jev models list              # everything this machine can call: price, context, vision, reasoning
jev models providers         # which providers you hold a key or login for
jev models suggest --write   # first-draft pools from price bands; then edit to taste
```

The catalog is [models.dev](https://models.dev), filtered to providers whose API-key name is set in your environment or Hermes `.env`, or that Hermes holds a login for. Only key *names* are read. Pools live in `~/.hermes/jev/routing.json` (the default for every profile); `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/jev/routing.json` overrides it for one profile. Details in [skills/jev-model-routing](skills/jev-model-routing/SKILL.md).

## Your API key never touches the agent

`jev setup-key` opens a one-time page served only by your own computer. You paste your [TypeSafe key](https://console.typesafe.ai/settings/keys) there. It goes straight into the OS secret store (macOS Keychain, or `secret-tool` on Linux, or a 0600 file as a last resort) and, on a Hermes machine, into each profile's `.env`. The agent that ran the command sees one line: stored, verified, yes or no. Never the key, not even a prefix.

The page lives on an unguessable one-time URL, refuses requests with a foreign `Host` header (DNS rebinding), sends no referrer, logs nothing, and shuts down after one use or ten minutes. On a headless box, run `jev setup-key --tty` yourself for a hidden prompt.

**Do not paste your key into a chat.** If you already did, make a new one.

## What leaves your machine

Jev is a cloud API, so this is spelled out rather than implied:

- **Routing**: the user's turn, redacted (emails, phones, tokens, long hex masked), capped at 2,500 characters (`ask_chars`), read as the opening and, mostly, the end. Never history, tool results, files or memory. Turns that look like they hold a secret, and any profile you list in `private_profiles`, send only coarse features: length, whether code is present, whether risk words appear.
- **Dispatch** (`hermes-dispatch`, off by default): when a turn Jev judged hard is handed to another agent, that agent's provider receives a handoff: the person's message and up to six recent user and assistant turns, text only, redacted, about 12,000 characters. System prompts, tool output, memory and files are never part of it. It stays on your machine, sent to no one, when:
  - the profile is highly sensitive (a profile you did not classify counts as one);
  - the message, or any turn the handoff would carry, uses a Dutch word for a client, a patient or a file. That is `cliënt` or `patiënt` in any form, `clienten` or `patienten` without the trema, and `dossier` in any form. The singular `client` and `patient` do not count, because they are English words too. It also stays when it names a conversation report, a treatment plan, an anamnesis, medication, a criminal record, debts, a BSN or an IBAN. You can add your own words in `dispatch.json`;
  - the message or any of those turns holds a secret value: a key, a token, a password. A question about passwords is not one.

  Jev reads a public turn as redacted text, and a private one, or any turn with words about passwords, keys or tokens, as coarse features. It is not asked about a highly sensitive turn at all. A public turn that holds contact details counts as private.
- **Memory**: the query and up to 900 characters per passage, redacted. Your store's ids, paths and sources are replaced with `P0`, `P1`… and never sent. A passage that looks like a credential is not sent at all.
- **Choosing turns** (`jev compact-select`, or handoffs with `HANDOFF_JEV=1`): the first and last 350 characters of each turn, redacted. Turns that look sensitive are skipped. A default handoff sends Jev nothing.
- **Skills**: the turn, redacted, plus skill names and descriptions.
- **Search** (`jev search`): the date, the question, the queries already tried, and up to 900 characters of each shortlisted result (title, URL, snippet), redacted. Result ids stay local: Jev sees `P0`, `P1`… A result that looks like a credential is not sent, and neither is one carrying hidden instructions. A question that looks sensitive is not sent at all.
- **Mailbox sorting** (`jev mail`): the subject and up to 2,500 characters of the body, redacted; the sender's **domain** (never the mailbox); a local class read off the address alone (**automated** for a mailbox that cannot receive a reply, **role** for a shared one a team reads, **list**, or **person**); the message's timestamp, and only the timestamp — a `Received:` header is reduced to the date it carries, because the rest of it is the recipient's address and the internal IP of every hop; whether the mail carries a real `List-Unsubscribe` header, and separately whether the body merely mentions unsubscribing; and whether you have replied in the thread. Mail is **decoded before it is screened** — quoted-printable, percent-encoding, HTML entities and base64 runs — because a newsletter footer carries your own address percent-encoded in the unsubscribe link and base64'd in the tracking link, and a plain-text redactor sees neither. Query strings are stripped from URLs for the same reason. A message that looks like it holds a secret is not sent at all, and the check runs on the decoded text, so a base64 MIME body cannot carry a key past it. What redaction does **not** remove: a person's display name (`Jane Vale <[email]>`) is sent as written. The body is also screened for text aimed at an agent; a hit is **flagged** on the result and never filed away, because one sentence in a body would otherwise be the most useful thing an attacker could reach here.
- **Computer and browser use**: the goal, short element labels, and your action descriptions. Never screenshots, page text or field values. A goal or label that looks sensitive is refused before sending.

Logs hold decisions only (tier, model, confidence, latency). Never prompt text.

One thing to be plain about: in the default `redacted-text` mode, routing sends the turn itself, redacted. The plugin also tells your agent never to send Jev customer data — and on an automatically routed turn the agent has no say in that, because routing happens before it acts. If a profile handles data that must not leave the machine, put it in `private_profiles`, which sends only coarse features (length, code present, risk words) and never the text.

## Everything fails open

No key, timeout, rate limit, malformed reply, low confidence: routing keeps your current model, memory returns the original list, compaction drops nothing, skill selection suggests nothing, search returns the screened head of your list with the decision marked `unknown`, and computer use returns `reobserve`. A Jev outage costs you at most the time budget (2.5 s for routing) and never blocks a turn.

Safety rails that do not depend on Jev being right:

- Risk words (production, delete, migration, security, payment, legal…) never route to the cheapest tier.
- A large context never switches to a cheaper model mid-session.
- A transcript turn is only dropped on a confident answer.
- Jev can only ever return an action id you put in the table.
