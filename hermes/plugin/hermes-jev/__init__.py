"""Hermes Jev plugin: lets TypeSafe Jev take the cheap decisions off the agent's plate.

Uses only public plugin seams, so it survives `hermes update`:

* ``pre_llm_call``       once per fresh user turn: remembers the turn, and (if on) suggests a skill
* ``llm_request``        middleware: swaps the model for that turn, within the connected provider
* ``transform_llm_output`` optionally shows the one-line routing notice
* tools + ``/jev``        memory filter, compaction selection, action chooser, status and switches

Everything fails open. If Jev is slow, down, unsure, or the turn looks private,
Hermes behaves exactly as it did before this plugin existed.
